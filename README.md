# yaww

Yet Another Winapi Wrapper, for safer Windows GUI programming.

This crate aims to wrap the Windows API in a safer wrapper that can be easily and soundly used from Rust code. Note that I've focused specifically on the Win32 GUI API, since other, better crates exist for other parts of the Windows API.

The overwhelming majority of the `yaww` crate consists of automatically generated bindings, generated by `yaww-generator`. For the most part, these bindings should be sound. If you believe that you have found a binding that invokes unsafe behavior, please file an issue.

`yaww` is currently in a very unstable state. Bindings may change between released in the future.

## Support

`yaww` was created mainly for the `WindowsAndMessaging` and `Gdi` APIs. Because those APIs have dependencies, `yaww` also pulls in certain other Win32 APIs. These other APIs are only around because I need them around and should be considered second class citizens.
